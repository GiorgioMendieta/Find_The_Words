## Install dependencies

The following dependencies must be installed:

`pip install flask`

- Needed for Python web server
- activate venv environment

`pip install python-dotenv`

- Needed for environment variables

`pip install requests`

- Needed for API calls

## Getting started

### Environment variables

We can use environment variables with `python-dotenv` and Flask to hide secrets such as API keys
(See this <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/cli/#environment-variables-from-dotenv> for help on how to use environment variables with flask)

Create `.env` file and add:

    RAPID_API_KEY = {KEY GOES HERE}

on `app.py` first we need to import the `os` package so that we can use the command `os.environ.get()` command to fetch the environment variable stored in `.env` file

### Signing up for API

Go to rapidapi.com, sign up and request for **Random words api**

### Running the server

- Execute `flask run`
- Go to <http://127.0.0.1:5000/>
